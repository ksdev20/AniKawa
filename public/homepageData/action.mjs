In a world where most people who become adventurers do so in their teens, a guild employee in his thirties, Rick Gladiator, seeks to become an adventurer instead. After receiving unimaginably brutal training from the legendary party renowned as the strongest on the continent, Orichalcum Fist, he ends up with combat abilities worthy of S-rank status despite starting out as an F-rank rookie! <br><br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

Then, he was reincarnated as Lloyd, the seventh prince of the Kingdom of Saloum and one blessed with a strong magical bloodline.
